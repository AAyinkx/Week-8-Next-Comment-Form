- I decided to challenge myself with joins and references this week so i limited each table to dealing with one entity only

## Reflection

- I am really pleased that we got a similar project this week so I could spend more time building on a project i started last week. I kept all my planning the same and wieframes and only changed my database format and certian aspects to meet this weeks requirements
- I was able to complete all of the CRUD endpoints somewhere on my site and found the use of dynamic routes a lot easier in next.js
- I also got to revisit and put into practice some SQL topics that I wasn't feeling too confident on before like refrences, joins and updates
- Another thing that i was able to complete as opposed to last week was the 'Sort by Genre' page. I don't have hardly enough data for all the genres, but i wanted to keep the options open ðŸ˜…. To check it actually works, i think 'Self Help' and 'Contemporary' have been assigned some reviews.
- I always have fun at styling but this week i wanted to spend more time on other elements so i re-used most of my styling from last week and just changed them slightly to ".module.css" that's why there is very little tailwind. I think i used it once or twice to change some font sizes.

## What bugs did I encounter? ðŸª²

- I had a NIGHTMARE with the delete SQL query because i didn't really make it easy for myself using seperate tables
  - After many attempts i was able to delete successfully as long as a deleted the entry from the junction table first before deleting the entry from the comments table
- **Unresoled issue:** I had this issue on friday with inamges and the _onError_ property. I had no issus with it last week however, this week, when trying to use if i had so many "404 Errors". I just used a default image for all the images as it wasn't really crucial to the functionality of the site
- I think my most common issue this weekend was manipulating the data retrieved to use it for a certain function. 'consol.loge(_typeof_ ) was definately overused
- With my update likes buttons and delete buttons I got really confused with what was meant to be a client element and a server element but I got some help to figure it our eventually
- One thing i would like to know id how to reset my comments form. I don't know if this is just a client action though because my comments form uses the server
